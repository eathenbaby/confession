## Option 1: Continue with GitHub Desktop (Easiest!)

GitHub Desktop should work better now that Git is installed:

1. **Open GitHub Desktop** (from your Start menu or taskbar)
2. **Make sure you're in the "Asset-Manager" repository**
3. **Click "Repository"** → **"Open in Terminal"**
4. **Type these commands**:

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
git status
```

You should see all your files listed!

```bash
git commit -m "Add all project files"
```

5. **Go back to GitHub Desktop** - you should see all files now!
6. **Click "Publish repository"**

## Option 2: Use Command Prompt/PowerShell

1. **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell**
2. **Navigate to your project**:
```bash
cd "C:\Users\eathe\OneDrive\Desktop\Asset-Manager\Asset-Manager-cleaned\Asset-Manager"
```

3. **Add all files**:
```bash
git add .
```

4. **Check status**:
```bash
git status
```

5. **Commit**:
```bash
git commit -m "Add all project files"
```

6. **Set remote** (if needed):
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/eathenbaby/valentine.git
```

7. **Push**:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Quick Test: Is Git Working?

1. **Open Command Prompt** (Windows Key + R, type `cmd`, Enter)
2. **Type**: `git --version`
3. **You should see**: `git version 2.xx.x`

If you see a version number, Git is working! ✅
