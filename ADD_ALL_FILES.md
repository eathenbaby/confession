# 📁 Add All Your Files to GitHub

You're only seeing 2 files because the rest haven't been added yet. Let's fix this!

---

## Option 1: Using GitHub Desktop (Easiest)

### Step 1: Check Your Repository
1. In GitHub Desktop, look at the left side
2. You should see "Changes" tab
3. Make sure you're in the right repository: "Asset-Manager"

### Step 2: Add All Files
1. At the bottom left, you should see a checkbox that says something like "2 changed files"
2. **Check that box** to select all files
3. OR look for a button that says "Select all" or "Stage all"

### Step 3: If Files Don't Show Up
Sometimes GitHub Desktop doesn't show all files. Try this:

1. **Click "File"** → **"Repository Settings"**
2. **Or click the gear icon** (⚙️) next to "Current repository"
3. Make sure the path is: `C:\Users\eathe\OneDrive\Desktop\Asset-Manager\Asset-Manager-cleaned\Asset-Manager`

### Step 4: Force Refresh
1. **Close GitHub Desktop**
2. **Reopen it**
3. **Click "File"** → **"Add Local Repository"** again
4. **Select your folder**: `C:\Users\eathe\OneDrive\Desktop\Asset-Manager\Asset-Manager-cleaned\Asset-Manager`
5. **Click "Add repository"**

Now you should see ALL your files!

## Option 2: Check What Files Are There

Let's verify all your files are in the folder:

1. **Open File Explorer** (Windows Key + E)
2. **Navigate to**: `C:\Users\eathe\OneDrive\Desktop\Asset-Manager\Asset-Manager-cleaned\Asset-Manager`
3. **You should see**:
   - `package.json`
   - `README.md`
   - `BEGINNER_GUIDE.md`
   - `client` folder
   - `server` folder
   - `shared` folder
   - And many other files

If you see all these files, they're there - GitHub Desktop just needs to see them!

## Option 3: Start Fresh (If Nothing Works)

If GitHub Desktop still doesn't show all files:

1. **In GitHub Desktop**, click **"File"** → **"Remove Repository"**
2. **Don't delete files** - just remove it from GitHub Desktop
3. **Click "File"** → **"Add Local Repository"**
4. **Click "Create a new repository"**
5. **Name**: `valentine`
6. **Local path**: `C:\Users\eathe\OneDrive\Desktop\Asset-Manager\Asset-Manager-cleaned\Asset-Manager`
7. **Click "Create repository"**
8. **Now you should see ALL files!**
9. **Type "First commit"** in Summary
10. **Click "Commit to main"**
11. **Click "Publish repository"**

## What You Should See

After adding all files, you should see:
- ✅ `package.json`
- ✅ `README.md`
- ✅ `BEGINNER_GUIDE.md`
- ✅ `client` folder (with many files inside)
- ✅ `server` folder (with files inside)
- ✅ `shared` folder
- ✅ All the `.md` files I created
- ✅ And many more!

**Total should be 30+ files!**

---

## Quick Check

1. **In GitHub Desktop**, look at the bottom
2. **It should say**: "X changed files" (where X is a big number like 30+)
3. **If it only says "2 changed files"**, the files aren't being detected

Try Option 3 (Start Fresh) - that usually fixes it!
